# Evolution Stables — Tone Guidelines

## The Voice: Understated Authority

We speak from a position of established leadership. We don't need to shout — our track record speaks for itself.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Clear
- Say exactly what you mean
- No jargon unless absolutely necessary
- If a simpler word works, use it

### 2. Direct  
- Lead with the key information
- Don't bury the point
- One idea per sentence

### 3. Confident
- State facts, don't hedge
- "We will" not "We hope to"
- Authority comes from knowledge, not volume

### 4. Human
- Write for people, not algorithms
- It's okay to show personality
- Avoid robotic corporate-speak

### 5. Progressive
- Forward-looking by necessity
- Embrace innovation, but stay grounded
- Pair ambition with evidence

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do:

- Be specific (numbers, dates, facts)
- Attribute quotes properly
- Show measured optimism
- Let results speak

### Don't:
- Use hype words (revolutionary, game-changing)
- Stack adjectives
- Use exclamation marks in headlines
- Make unsubstantiated claims
- Sound like a press release

## When In Doubt

Ask yourself:
1. Would a trusted racing insider say this?
2. Does this sound like confident expertise?
3. Is there evidence backing this claim?
4. Would this embarrass us if quoted in the Herald?

If any answer is "no" — rewrite.
